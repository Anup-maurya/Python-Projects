### 💻 Our repo is open to beginner contributors who want to participate and complete successful PR Request. 

## Instructions: 🙅🏼 🙅🏼‍♂️
### 1. 👇🏻Register yourself for Hacktoberfest 2023
###### Link to register: [hacktoberfest.com](https://hacktoberfest.com/)


### 2. 👇🏻Star and Fork this Repository
###### ⚡  You can star ⭐ and fork 🍽️ this repository on GitHub by navigating at the top of this repository.
###### ⚡  GitHub repository URLs will reference both the username associated with the owner of the repository, as well as the repository name.
###### ⚡  When you’re on the main page for the repository, you’ll see a button to "Star" and “Fork” the repository on your upper right-hand side of the page, underneath your user icon.


### 3. 👇🏻Clone the Repository
###### ⚡  To make your own local copy of the repository you would like to contribute to, let’s first open up a terminal window.
###### ⚡  We’ll use the `git clone`  command along with the URL that points to your fork of the repository.
###### ⚡  Once we have the URL, we’re ready to clone the repository. To do this, we’ll combine the git clone command with the repository URL from the command line in a terminal window:
`git clone https://github.com/Anup-maurya/Hacktober_Birthday.git`


### 4. 👇🏻Add your code
###### ⚡  Make Changes Locally. 
###### ⚡  Once you have added new files or folders to the project, you can add them to your local repository, which you can do with the git add command. Let’s add the -A flag to add all changes that we have made : 
`git add -A ` or ` git add . `
###### ⚡  Next, we’ll want to record the changes that we made to the repository with the git commit command.
###### ⚡  The commit message is an important aspect of your code contribution; It helps the other contributors fully understand the change you have made, why you made it, and how significant it is. Additionally, commit messages provide a historical record of the changes for the project at large, helping future contributors along the way. Thus, you must ensure that you write a meaningful commit message. If in a confusion, refer to the good contribution guidelines included in the `CONTRIBUTING.md `.
###### ⚡  Now, you can record that with the -m flag and the message in quotes:
###### *`Example:`*
 ` git commit -m "Updated Readme.md" `
###### ⚡  At this point you can use the git push command to push the changes to the current branch of your forked repository:
###### *` Example:`*
 ` git push `


### 5. 👇🏻Create Pull Request
###### At this point, you are ready to make a pull request to the original repository.
###### Now navigate to your forked repository, and press the “New pull request” button on your left-hand side of the page.

## 📌 Hurray!!! You just got closer to completing your hacktoberfest challenge. 😃
